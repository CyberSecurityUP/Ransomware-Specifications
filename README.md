# **Specification for Ransomware Development**

## **1. Core Features**

### **1.1. File Encryption**
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Use AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode to encrypt files.
- **Key and IV**: Generate a 256-bit key and a 128-bit random initialization vector (IV) for each operation.
- **File Extension**: Append a custom extension (e.g., `.locked`) to encrypted files.
- **Target File Types**: Encrypt documents, images, videos, databases, and other valuable files.

### **1.2. Persistence**
- **Windows Registry**: Add an entry to the registry to execute ransomware at system startup.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Create a scheduled task to ensure continuous execution.

### **1.3. Propagation**
- **Local Network**: Exploit vulnerabilities like EternalBlue or SMB to spread within the local network.
- **USB Devices**: Copy itself to connected USB drives and spread to other systems.

### **1.4. Evasion Techniques**
- **Antivirus Evasion**:
  - Obfuscate code to avoid signature detection.
  - Use "fileless malware" techniques to execute code directly in memory.
  - Disable antivirus and security tools.
- **UAC Bypass**: Exploit weaknesses in User Account Control (UAC) to run with elevated privileges.
- **Sandbox Evasion**: Detect sandbox environments (e.g., check memory, processes, or unusual hardware).

### **1.5. Shadow Copy Manipulation**
- **Shadow Copy Deletion**: Use `vssadmin` to delete shadow copies and prevent file recovery.

### **1.6. Security Feature Disabling**
- **Firewall**: Disable Windows Firewall using `netsh`.
- **Windows Defender**: Disable Windows Defender via registry or PowerShell.
- **Recovery Mode**: Disable recovery mode using `bcdedit`.

### **1.7. User Notification**
- **Ransom Note**: Create a text or image file with payment instructions (e.g., `README.txt` or `HOW_TO_DECRYPT.html`).
- **Wallpaper**: Change the system wallpaper to display the ransom message.

## **2. Advanced Evasion Techniques**

### **2.1. Code Obfuscation**
- Use tools like **ConfuserEx** or **Armadillo** to obfuscate code and avoid antivirus detection.

### **2.2. Memory Execution**
- Load the ransomware directly into memory using techniques like **PowerShell Reflection** or **Process Hollowing**.

### **2.3. Anti-Debugging**
- Implement techniques to detect and avoid debugging, such as:
  - Checking for the presence of debuggers (e.g., OllyDbg, x64dbg).
  - Using API calls like `IsDebuggerPresent`.

### **2.4. Anti-Sandbox**
- Detect if the system is running in a sandbox:
  - Check RAM amount (sandboxes often have low memory).
  - Detect running processes (e.g., malware analysis tools).

## **3. Effective Programming Languages**

### **3.1. C/C++**
- **Advantages**:
  - High performance.
  - Direct access to Windows API.
  - Easy code obfuscation.
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, MinGW.

### **3.2. Python**
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast development.
  - Powerful libraries for encryption and networking.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Easy to detect without obfuscation.
  - Requires Python interpreter installed.

### **3.3. PowerShell**
- **Advantages**:
  - Natively present in Windows.
  - Can be used for fileless techniques.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Easily detected by modern security solutions.

### **3.4. Go (Golang)**
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy cross-platform compilation.
  - Effective obfuscation with tools like **Garble**.

## **4. Impact and Effectiveness**

### **4.1. Financial Impact**
- Demand payment in cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) to make tracking difficult.

### **4.2. Operational Impact**
- Disrupt critical systems, such as hospitals, businesses, and governments.

### **4.3. Psychological Impact**
- Create urgency and fear in the user to force payment.

## **5. Containment and Prevention Measures**

### **5.1. Regular Backups**
- Maintain frequent offline backups to restore files without paying the ransom.

### **5.2. Security Updates**
- Keep systems and software updated to patch vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware.

### **5.3. User Education**
- Train users to avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening unknown email attachments.

### **5.4. Security Solutions**
- Use modern antivirus with behavioral detection.
- Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

### **5.5. Network Segmentation**
- Isolate critical systems on separate networks to limit ransomware spread.

### **5.6. Execution Restrictions**
- Use Group Policy (GPO) to restrict execution of scripts and suspicious files.

### **5.7. Continuous Monitoring**
- Implement monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities in real-time.

## **6. Incident Response**

### **6.1. System Isolation**
- Disconnect infected systems from the network to prevent further spread.

### **6.2. Forensic Analysis**
- Collect evidence to understand the attack vector and ransomware behavior.

### **6.3. Data Recovery**
- Use backups to restore encrypted files.

### **6.4. Law Enforcement Notification**
- Report the incident to appropriate authorities for investigation.
